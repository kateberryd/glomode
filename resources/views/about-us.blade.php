                           <p>Mrs. Agnes Bamgbala is a graduate of the University of Ibadan, Ibadan with a Second Class Upper Bachelor of Arts honours degree in History and a Master’s in Industrial and Labour Relations obtained from the institution in 1980 and 1982 respectively. In the course of her 31 year career, she has worked in both the private and public sectors in various capacities. She joined the services of the National Universities Commission in 2006 as Chief Personnel Officer, Office of the Executive Secretary.  She rose through the ranks and by dint of hard work and in recognition of her passion for the qualitative development of the Nigerian University System, she was appointed Ag. Director, Inspection and Monitoring, on the 6th of August, 2019. She retained this position until her retirement at the age of sixty on 26th January, 2020. 

                            Mrs. Agnes Bamgbala is particularly concerned about the welfare of unemployed youths, the aged and widows and is eager to lend support to credible youth empowerment initiatives. The inability of the Nigerian University System to absorb all qualified candidates yearly is also of serious concern to her. Mrs. Bamgbala was very passionate about her job as a Regulatory Officer at the National Universities Commission, and regards the production of highly skilled manpower as being key to the attainment of national development goals. She is consequently delighted to serve Glomode in an advisory capacity. In this regard she has been of immense assistance in identifying programmes in which Nigeria is lacking in highly skilled manpower, and which Glomode wishes to promote through its overseas scholarship scheme to the University of the West Indies, Mona.  </p>
